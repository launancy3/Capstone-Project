		<img src="images/HealthRisks4.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" class="w3-margin-top">
		<p>Developing Respiratory Conditions: Poor air quality, especially from pollutants like nitrogen dioxide (NOâ‚‚) and PM2.5, can cause lung inflammation and lead to diseases such as asthma and bronchitis. Prolonged exposure increases the risk of chronic respiratory diseases.</p>
		<p>Triggers Pre-Existing Respiratory Conditions: Those with asthma, COPD, or allergies may experience worsened symptoms when exposed to pollutants. High pollution levels can trigger asthma attacks as people with asma are at greater risks from breathing in small particles(PM2.5) and irritating gasses, which can irritate the air way and cause the asma to worsen. Researchers have long-linked that chronic respiratory disease have affected the quality of life of more thahn 23 millian people. </p>
		
<!-- About PM2.5 -->
		<h5 class="w3-padding-54"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">What is PM2.5?</span></h5>
		<p>PM stands for particulate matter. (Also known as particle pollutant as mentioned previously)</p>
	    <p>Well Why Are Pollutant Particles A Problem?</p>
		<img src="images/ParticlePollutant.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" class="w3-margin-top">
		<p>These particles can be found year round and can contribute to the poor air quality problems in many major cities including other areas of the United States. Pollutant Particles may remain in the atmosphere to a few days or even weeks and consequently, these particles can generated in one area and can travel hundreds and thousands of miles of influence spreading to neighboring cities. </p>
		<p>Particle Pollutant levels are particularly high in . . . </p>
		<p>  * Near busy roads where cars can emmit toxic pollutants like urban areas (especially during rush hour) pollutans admitted can be very high </p>
		<p> * Smoke admitted into the air due to fireplaces, campires, barbeques, etc</p>
			
	
<!-- Health risk of Pm2.5 -->
		<h5 class="w3-padding-54"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Health Risks of PM2.5 Exposure</span></h5>
		<p> * People with underlying cardiovasular conditions (ex: heart disease, heart failure) or people who recently experienced cardiovasular events (ex: stroke) </p>
		<p> * People with diabetes </p>
		<p> * People with elevated cholestoral levels</p>
		<p> * People who are obese</p>
		<p> * Greater risk of infant mortality</p>
	

<!-- Statistics -->
		
		<h5 class="w3-padding-54"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Statistics of Death Rates From Air Pollution</span></h5>
		<img src="images/Statistics.webp" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" class="w3-margin-top">
		<p>Higher Death Rates: Long-term exposure to air pollution has been linked to increased mortality rates due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution contributes to millions of premature deaths worldwide each year. Especially in counties like china air pollutant is responsible for about 7 million deaths per year.</p>

		<img src="images/HealthRisk2.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" class="w3-margin-top">
		<p>Reduces Respiratory Issues: When pollution levels are kept low, the risk of developing respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) decreases. Cleaner air means fewer irritants that can inflame the airways and lungs. With better air quality it also reduces the change of children developing respiratory issues at a young age, since childrens organs are sitll developing it makes them more vulnerable to health risks from exposure to polluted air. Making it essential to take pecautions to protect their well being. </p>
		<p>Better Cardiovascular Health: Studies show that lower air pollution levels are associated with a lower risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases. Pollutants like fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can enter the bloodstream and cause inflammation, leading to heart problems.  </p>

		<p>Increased Life Expectancy: Research has found that areas with cleaner air tend to have higher life expectancies. Long-term exposure to poor air quality can reduce lifespan due to chronic diseases caused by pollution exposure.
