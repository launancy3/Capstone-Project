	<h5 class="w3-left w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide"> 1. Tackling The Climate Crisis üåÅ</span></h5>
	<img src="images/Washington.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" class="w3-margin-top">
	<p>In the first year of the Biden-Harris Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took significant steps forward in tackling the climate crisis.</p>
	<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken significant steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote clean energy. One of its major accomplishments is finalizing the most ambitious federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks for Model Years 2023-2026. These regulations are projected to avoid more than 3 billion tons of GHG emissions by 2050, equivalent to over half of the total U.S. CO‚ÇÇ emissions in 2019. The EPA‚Äôs efforts also improve fuel efficiency, helping American drivers save between $210 billion and $420 billion on fuel costs by 2050. To accelerate the transition to clean transportation, the agency has set policies that encourage the growth of electric vehicle (EV) sales, which are expected to rise from 7% in 2023 to 17% in 2026. Additionally, the EPA is supporting clean energy infrastructure with $7.5 billion allocated for 500,000 public EV charging stations by 2030 and over $7 billion invested in battery manufacturing, materials, and recycling to reduce costs and increase sustainability. These actions not only advance the shift to a zero-emission future but also protect public health by reducing pollution, especially in overburdened and underserved communities located near highways and industrial areas. By implementing these policies, the EPA is leading efforts to combat climate change while ensuring a cleaner, healthier environment for future generations.</p>

	<h5 class="w3-left w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">2. Investing In Safe And Healthy Water üö∞</span></h5>
	<img src="images/Drinking.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" class="w3-margin-top">
<p> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making historic investments in America‚Äôs water infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aiming to upgrade aging systems and address critical water quality issues. In 2022, the EPA allocated $7.4 billion to states, Tribes, and territories, with nearly half available as grants or principal forgiveness loans to support underserved communities. 
<p>Over the next five years, states will receive nearly $44 billion in dedicated EPA funding to improve drinking water safety, particularly by reducing lead contamination and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pollution. These investments prioritize historically marginalized areas that have faced disproportionate environmental burdens.</p>
<p>The program builds on more than 30 years of EPA‚Äôs State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs, which have provided low-cost financing for local water projects. By partnering with states, the EPA ensures that these investments reach communities in need, helping to eliminate water pollution, protect public health, and correct long-standing environmental injustices.</p>

	<h5 class="w3-left w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">3. Stopping The Use Of Pesticides üìâ</span></h5>
	<img src="images/Pesticides.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" class="w3-margin-top">
	<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken a major step to protect public health by banning the use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos on all food. Chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate insecticide used on crops like soybeans, fruit and nut trees, and vegetables, has been linked to neurotoxicity and potential neurological effects in children. 
	<p>In response to a court order and a long-standing petition from environmental and public health groups, the EPA revoked all tolerances for chlorpyrifos, meaning no amount of the pesticide is allowed on food. This decision aligns with actions taken by the European Union, Canada, and several U.S. states, including California, Hawaii, and New York, to restrict its use.</p> 
	<p>While farmers have historically relied on chlorpyrifos, its use has already been declining due to state-level restrictions and the availability of safer alternatives. By following the science and prioritizing public health, the EPA's ban on chlorpyrifos ensures safer food and better protection for children and farmworkers from harmful pesticide exposure.</p>

	<h5 class="w3-left w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">4. Reducing Led Exposure üìâ</span></h5>
	<img src="images/Led.webp" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" class="w3-margin-top">
	<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed the Strategy to Reduce Lead Exposures and Disparities in U.S. Communities to tackle the critical issue of lead exposure, especially in high-risk communities. This strategy focuses on eliminating disparities in blood lead levels that disproportionately affect children in racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic communities. 
		
	<p>The EPA's approach involves four key goals: reducing community exposures to lead sources, identifying high-exposure areas, improving communication with stakeholders, and supporting research to inform policy decisions.</p>
		
	<p>The strategy has three main approaches: targeting local communities with a focus on environmental justice, developing national standards and tools to reduce lead exposures, and collaborating with various federal, state, tribal, and local partners to address lead contamination on a broader scale.</p>
		
	<p>Through extensive public engagement and feedback, the EPA has refined the strategy to ensure effective, evidence-based actions that will protect children‚Äôs health and promote equity. This initiative underscores the agency‚Äôs commitment to reducing lead exposure risks, improving health outcomes, and advancing environmental justice across the United States.</p>

	<img src="images/TrumpEPA.webp" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" class="w3-margin-top">
	<p>Under President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration, significant changes were proposed for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with a focus on drastically reducing its size and operations. In a cabinet meeting, President Trump mentioned plans by Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the EPA, to cut 65 percent of the agency‚Äôs staff, a move that would eliminate nearly 10,000 jobs. This would have a devastating impact on the EPA‚Äôs ability to protect public health and the environment, as fewer staff would be available to respond to natural disasters, conduct hazardous cleanups, monitor air quality, and address lead contamination. Despite the proposal, it was later clarified that the 65 percent cut was part of broader budget reductions rather than a direct personnel cut.</p>
	<p>The Trump administration also made efforts to eliminate what it considered a "bloated" federal bureaucracy, with a focus on cutting costs and regulations. This included dismissing hundreds of probationary employees and placing others on administrative leave, particularly those working to protect underserved communities from pollution. The administration‚Äôs goal was to weaken environmental regulations, with a particular focus on reducing restrictions for the fossil fuel industry, which had supported Trump‚Äôs campaign financially </p>
