									<h2>My Story Behind The Project!</h2>
								</header>
								<p>My personal connection to this topic stems from my interest in environmental science and public health, in learning about the health impacts of being exposed to bad air quality and my desire to advocate for families with respiratory issues such as asthma strengthened as Asma runs in my family. I wanted this capstone project to advocate for those communities. Initially at the start of this project, the original goal was to compare air quality globally and what initiatives different countries globally take to ensure safe and clean air to breathe. 
								<br />
								<br />
								After additional reevaluation I was able to find and develop the creation of this website. The main goal is to see with the use of technology how this can help save the environment. Shedding light on the importance of air quality and why it is so important to have organizations and foundations established to continue this idea of clean/fresh air for civilians to breathe without any life long health risks.</p>

								<p>Air Quality Effects Across the Globe: Air quality varies significantly across different regions, impacting public health in diverse ways. Some areas face more severe pollution, leading to increased health risks for residents. Under this tab you will find resources and initiatives other areas globally are taking to combat this air quality issue.
								<br />
								<br />
								The Importance of the EPA: Recent news has underscored the essential role of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in regulating air quality standards and ensuring that communities have access to clean, safe air. Under this tab it will talk about the importance the organization EPA is because it protects human health and the environment. 
								<br />
								<br />
								Health Risks of Poor Air Quality: Under this tab you will learn that the exposure to polluted air poses significant health risks, particularly for individuals with respiratory issues like asthma. Chronic exposure can lead to serious, long-term health complications. 
								<br />
								<br />
								Resources for Action: Our resources page provides important data on air quality levels, actionable steps to reduce pollution, and guidance on how individuals and communities can contribute to cleaner air.</p>
