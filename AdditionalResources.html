		<p>My personal connection to this topic stems from my interest in environmental science and public health, in learning about the health impacts of being exposed to bad air quality and my desire to advocate for families with respiratory issues such as asthma strengthened as Asma runs in my family. I wanted this capstone project to advocate for those communities. Initially at the start of this project, the original goal was to compare air quality globally and what initiatives different countries globally take to ensure safe and clean air to breathe.</p>
